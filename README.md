# Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘»

I am Avo Hagopian! I am constantly learning about the software development world by working on personal passion projects.

I have a lot of experience with C, C++, Javascript, and React, and I'm still trying to learn new things everyday!

A lot of content is hosted on my other github account [GhostTheBoo](https://github.com/GhostTheBoo).
